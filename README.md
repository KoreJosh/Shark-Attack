-Power BI - For conditional formatting
-Tableau - For visualization

## Data Cleaning/ Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase , we performed the following tasks:
- Data loading on Microsoft Excel
- Inspection for missing values, wrong spellings and variable type
- Filtering and editting misspellings and grouping of species
- conditional formatting in Power Query for the age band
- Date transformation for time of day of attack.
- Text analysis on the Injury column

  ## Exploratory Data Analysis
  
  - Trend of annual number of shark attacks since 1900
  - Countries with the most Shark Attacks.
  - What time of day was the attack prevelant, are attacks more comon during the day or night or during the afternoon?
  - Body part mostly attacked?
  - Which species of shark are attacking most often?
  - Whats the age band of the victims, and which age band was mostly attacked?

## Result/Findings
- With an over 900 attacks, Juvenile Sharks were the verocious species of sharks within this period
- Sharks attack predominately during the afternnon, followed by in the morning and little at night.
- More attacks were recoreded in the USA with over 2000 attacks as aginst any other countries.
